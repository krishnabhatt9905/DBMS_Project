## 🚀 How to Use

### First Time Setup

1. **Create a Fresh Database**:
   ```sql
   -- For MySQL
   CREATE DATABASE funding_system;
   
   -- For PostgreSQL
   CREATE DATABASE funding_system;
   ```

2. **Import Database Schema**:
   ```bash
   # For MySQL
   mysql -u root -p funding_system < database_schema.sql
   
   # For PostgreSQL
   psql -U postgres funding_system < database_schema_postgresql.sql
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Automatic Seeding**: The application will automatically detect an empty database and populate it with sample data.

### Manual Seeding

If you want to manually seed the database:

```bash
python seed_data.py
```

### Testing with Sample Data

1. Visit `http://localhost:5001`
2. Click "Startup Login" or "Investor Login"
3. Use any of the sample credentials above
4. Password: `password123` for all sample accounts

## 📱 Responsive Design

The entire application is now fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured layout with all elements visible
- **Tablet**: Adjusted grid layouts for medium screens

## 📝 Notes

- The seed data script is **idempotent** - it won't duplicate data if run multiple times
- All sample passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security
- The system automatically detects if running locally (MySQL) or on Render (PostgreSQL)
- Seed data provides realistic examples for demonstration and testing

## 🔄 Updating Seed Data

To modify the seed data, edit `seed_data.py`:
- Add more startups/investors
- Change domain preferences
- Adjust funding amounts
- Update match scores

Then run:
```bash
# Drop and recreate database
mysql -u root -p -e "DROP DATABASE funding_system; CREATE DATABASE funding_system;"
mysql -u root -p funding_system < database_schema.sql

# Run app (will auto-seed)
python app.py
```
