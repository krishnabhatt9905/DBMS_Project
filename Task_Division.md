   - Eliminated data redundancy
   - Ensured optimal database structure

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Applied constraints: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK

   - Set up cascading rules (ON DELETE, ON UPDATE)

5. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Implemented One-to-Many relationships (Investor â†’ Investments)
   - Created junction tables for Many-to-Many relationships
   - Documented all relationships

### Deliverables:

## ðŸ”— Module Dependencies

```
Student 1 (Schema) â†’ Student 2 (Queries) â†’ Student 3 (Application) â†’ Student 4 (Reports)
                           â†“
                   All modules feed into
                           â†“
                  Student 4 (Integration)
```

## âœ… Evaluation Points

Each student can independently explain:
- **What** they built (their specific module)
- **How** they implemented it (technical details)
- **Why** their decisions were made (justification)
- **Challenges** faced and solutions applied
- **How** their module connects with others

---

**Note**: All students should have basic understanding of the entire system, but deep expertise in their assigned module.
