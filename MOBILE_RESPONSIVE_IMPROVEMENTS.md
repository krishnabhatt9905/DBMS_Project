## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Responsive Navigation Menu**
- **Desktop**: Horizontal navigation bar with logo and menu items
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu (☰) that expands/collapses on tap
- **Features**:
  - Toggle button appears automatically on screens < 768px
  - Menu items stack vertically for easy thumb navigation
  - Auto-closes when clicking outside or selecting a menu item
  - Smooth transitions and animations

### 2. **Flexible Grid Layouts**
Created three responsive grid utility classes:
- **`.grid-2`**: 2-column grid on desktop → 1-column on mobile
- **`.grid-3`**: 3-column grid on desktop → 2-column on tablet → 1-column on mobile
- **`.grid-4`**: 4-column grid on desktop → 2-column on tablet → 1-column on mobile

Applied to:
- Dashboard profile information
- Statistics cards
- Feature showcases
- Technology stack listings

### 3. **Mobile-Optimized Tables**
- **Horizontal scrolling** enabled for wide tables

- **H3**: 24px (desktop) → 18px (mobile)
- **Body text**: Optimized for readability on small screens

- Minimum touch target size of 44x44px (iOS guidelines)

### 6. **Form Optimization**
- **Full-width inputs** on mobile
- Font size set to 16px to prevent auto-zoom on iOS
- Adequate spacing between form fields

- Shadows and borders scale appropriately

### 8. **Content Padding**
Progressive padding based on screen size:

- **Body**: 20px (desktop) → 10px (mobile)

## 📐 Breakpoints

The design uses a mobile-first approach with these breakpoints:

```css
/* Mobile (default) */
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Mobile-specific styles */
}

/* Tablet */
@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) and (min-width: 769px) {
    /* Tablet-specific styles */
}

/* Desktop */
/* Default styles (1025px+) */
```

```
